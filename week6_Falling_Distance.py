"""

----------------------------------- PROBLEM STATEMENT -----------------------------------
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be
used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
D = (1/2)(g)(t^2)
The variables in the formula are as follows:
-D is the distance in meters,
-g is the gravitational force,which is 9.8N, and
-t is the amount of time in seconds that the object has been falling.,
Write a program that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds). The program
should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that
time (write an appropriate comment).
